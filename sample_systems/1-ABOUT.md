# AVglue/sample_systems
Provides examples of system definitions that can be read in by the AVglue
library to describe how comonents need to interact.

AVglue allows users to describe the components of their system using
relatively flat folder structures, and .toml files that will hopefully be
easy to read and edit.

TODO:
The AVglue library provides functions to ingest these files, and construct
all relevant datastructures needed to coordinate all system components and
simplify their use.
